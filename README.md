# Txedt

### Why is it spelled like that?

It originated in the phrase "Text edit" and though a bunch of
shortenings and spelling changes became "Txedt" (pronounced "dsedit").

### Why does it use its own ""programming language"" (lisp dialect)

I wanted to use lisp more because I found it enjoyable to program
in, but installing and using a raylib binding was, to summarize,
complete ass (mostly due to the fact I use windows). It was literally
easier to make my own dialect.

# Txedt

### Why is it spelled like that?

It originated in the phrase "Text edit" and through a bunch of
shortenings and spelling changes became "Txedt" (pronounced "dsedit").

### Why does it use its own ""programming language"" (lisp dialect)

I wanted to use lisp more because I found it enjoyable to program
in, but the process of installing a raylib binding was so bad (mostly 
because I use windows), that making a dialect was simply easier for me.
